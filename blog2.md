## A Silent Encounter – The Communication I Never Expected

Sometimes, space can be a quiet place. Too quiet. The hum of the ship’s engines is the only thing that keeps me from feeling utterly alone. But a few days ago, something shattered that silence.

I was drifting through a remote part of the Kessler Nebula, the swirling gas clouds lit by distant stars when my comm system unexpectedly lit up. At first, I assumed it was just a glitch, or maybe some stray radio interference from a nearby system. But then, I heard a voice.

It was faint at first, barely audible, as if it were coming from the depths of a cave. The voice spoke in a language I didn’t recognize, but there was something unmistakable about the tone – it wasn’t human.

I spent hours trying to decode the message, tuning into different frequencies, but the more I listened, the clearer it became that it wasn’t just some cosmic noise. The voice was speaking directly to me, and I swear, I felt a shiver down my spine as the words seemed to reach into the very core of my being.

The message ended abruptly, and all that remained was static. But I know what I heard. I’m certain of it.

I’ve reported the incident to my home base, but they’ve brushed it off as a possible anomaly – an echo from a distant system. They want me to focus on more “urgent” matters, but how can I? The feeling that I’ve made contact with something – or someone – out there is gnawing at me.

I can’t ignore it. Whoever, or whatever, was on the other end of that transmission, I know I’ve barely scratched the surface. Maybe I’m not as alone in the universe as I thought.

Until then, I’ll be listening. I’ll be waiting for the next signal, hoping that next time, the message will be clearer.
